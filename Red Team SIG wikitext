== Red Team SIG ==
The Fedora Red Team is Red Hat's upstream cybersecurity community. This SIG is
the community focal point for offensive tooling, exploit curation, standards,
and reference architectures.

=== Mission ===
To be the catalyst in the enterprise Linux community that enables Computer
Network Operations, the open source way.

=== Defining the term "cyber" ===
Ther term "cyber" itself is somewhat overloaded.

For purposes of this SIG, let the term “cyber” be defined as:

* Being rooted in the Greek word, κυβερνάω (kubernao), literally, to steer or
govern. Note that this is the same root word for Kubernetes.
* Based on the term “cybernetics,” which was coined by Norbert Wiener during
WWII, and later morphed into “cyberspace,” which was popularized by William
Gibson’s Neuromancer. Justice Department attorney Michael Vatis, in need of a
term to describe the new domain, referred to Neuromancer during the development
of the Marsh Report.
* Defined as the “fifth domain of warfare” by the US Department of Defense
(the others being land, sea, air, and space)
* Used as an umbrella term to describe the Computer Network Operations (CNO)
triplet of Computer Network Defense (CND), Computer Network Exploitation (CNE),
and Computer Network Attack (CNA)

Where terms like security and infosec are broad and refer to a branch of
computer science, cyber should be understood to refer to the antagonistic
world of nation state electronic warfare, Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
actors, and cyber criminals.

In this context, Red Teams are “friendlies” who attempt to break systems being
defended by the Blue Teams in order to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
It’s from this Red-vs-Blue concept that the Fedora Red Team draws its naming
inspiration.

=== Relationship with Fedora Security Lab ===
Fedora Security Lab is great. Packaging security tools is an important task,
but with the advent and adoption rate of the Open Container Image Format,
rpm-packaged tools have become less critical.

Container images for discrete cyber tools may have a wider impact. See the
section below on Red Container.

=== Tooling ===
FRT will make original tools, starting with the three listed below.

==== ELEM ====
Enterprise Linux Exploit Mapper (ELEM) uses the yum security plugin and Red Hat
Security Data API to map CVEs to known exploits in the wild. The initial data
source for exploits will be the Exploit Database, but other data sources can be
added later.

An important aspect of this project is “exploit curation.” Many vulnerabilities
discovered and documented via CVE contain theoretical vulnerabilities. These
CVEs use language like “this vulnerability may permit an attacker to execute
arbitrary code.” Other vulnerabilities are associated with exploits that have
been tested and are known to permit remote code execution, local privilege
escalation, or other classes of exploits.

The exploit curation process requires FRT testers to:

* Map local CVEs to exploits on Exploit DB
* Test those exploits on vulnerable systems
* Document which exploits are able to leverage the vulnerability

This project will initially curate CentOS vulnerabilities. CentOS CVEs and
RHEL CVEs are mostly the same, and Fedora CVE mapping is more difficult than
querying the Security Data API.

(New 9/12 idea) Could use output to influence NVD scoring after the fact. “CVE
Refresh,” perhaps. Automated comparison of CVE NVD score at time of issue
compared to curated vulnerability and need to re-score.

==== Fedora Security Data API ====
Fedora CVE mappings and security data a-la the Red Hat Security Data API.

==== FCTL ====
Fedora Cyber Test Lab is an open source implementation of the Cyber-ITL dynamic
analysis approach. Originally described at Def Con 24, the Cyber-ITL examines
disassembled binaries for complexity, "application armoring," developer hygene,
and susceptibility to fuzzing.

Aside from the obvious benefits of bug hunting at scale, the Cyber-ITLs reports
will probably be used to quantify software risk and enable a burgeoning cyber i
nsurance industry.

At this year’s Def Con 25, the Cyber-ITL provided an update including a
histogram of the latest RHEL 7 AMI’s security performance. While RHEL’s
performance wasn’t any worse than other Linuxes -- it was actually slightly
better -- the results are not repeatable.

The Fedora Cyber Test Lab (FCTL) will endeavor to recreate the Cyber-ITL’s
approach in an open source, repeatable fashion. The initial release of the FCTL
tooling will include:

* Cyclomatic complexity
* Branch frequency
* Hardening features as identified by hardening-check(1)
* Known-bad functions
** Note: without the Cyber-ITLs mass fuzzing results, we have no way of scoring
functions in terms of “badness.” Instead we’ll track the presence or absence of
functions on a bad list and sum the hits. This is not as high-fidelity as the
Cyber-ITL’s approach, but it’s a start.

The FCTL will make its findings open source, and provide Ansible test harnesses
to recreate those findings. While the FRT will focus on RHEL, CentOS, and
Fedora, the project will be open and receptive to community contributions for
other OSes.

==== Red Container ====
Adoption of the Open Container Image Format is changing the packaging landscape.
RPMs are still useful, but getting community adoption and participation in a
containerization effort is easier than that of a packaging effort.

The Red Container project will work on containerizing the popular tooling in
Kali Linux so that they can be run from any Linux distro, including Fedora,
CentOS, and RHEL.

Initial focus will be given to pentesting tools not already packaged in the
Fedora repos or in EPEL such as:

* Metasploit Framework
* nikto
* cewl
* enum4linux
* nbtscan

Other tools will be added after that, including a controlled interface to install package groups similar to those of Kali, and to invoke those tools from the CLI without having to call `docker run`.

=== Exploit Curation ===
The Fedora Red Team will test vulnerability / exploit combinations and document the ones that can be leveraged by attackers. This curation will take place under the ELEM project, see above.

=== Pen Testing Execution Standard (PTES) ===
The PTES project is very useful, although outdated. The FRT plans to either re-invigorate the project, or fork it entirely, and to use it as our process and documentation standard.

=== Reference Architectures ===
Red Hat’s NAPS geo has been successful selling so-called “cyber ranges.” While the concept of a cyber range has yet to be officially defined by NIST, it can be thought of as a cyber analog to kinetic weapons ranges. New machine guns aren’t developed and tested near civilians, they’re developed in special labs and tested in safe, specialized locations. Cyber weapons and defensive technologies require their own safe places. We call those cyber ranges.

Red Hat technologies like OpenStack, OpenShift, CloudForms, and Ansible fit perfectly into the problem space of cyber ranges, the gross functions for which could be described as:

* Training and Simulation: practicing Red Team and Blue Team operations
* Analysis: reverse engineering, sim/stim, C2 hijacking, attribution
* Research & Development: building new offensive and defensive capabilities

Building an environment that can support these features is very much an “infrastructure problem,” but it spans multiple project upstreams -- RDO, Origin, ManageIQ, etc. It makes sense for the Fedora Project to be the fulcrum for cyber range designs, white papers, reference architectures, etc.
